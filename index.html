		        The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) invites students to prepare for some of the most coveted jobs and most important advances in technology today, 		by pursuing the degrees we offer in computer science, applied mathematics, and robotics:</p>
		        <p>
		        <ul class="standard">
			        <li>BS in computer science</li> </br>
			        <li>BS in applied and computational mathematics</li> </br>
			        <li>MS in computational sciences and robotics </li> </br>
		        </ul>
		        </p>

		        <p>
		        Our BS computer science degree is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,   <a href="http://www.abet.org">http://www.abet.org</a>
